# Preface

A mini personal library of mine, storing books and useful materials that I am reading or plan to read. 
I also list links to some useful websites below, since I am tired of searching for them in by browser bookmarks, especially when I try to sync them between Chrome and Edge.
Now I can conveniently get access to my books while switching between Linux and Windows ^_^.

**Personal use only.**
